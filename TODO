o Can we keep *all* files in an "IDB" type database? That way we can reference
  source files by basename only:
     
      app.bin
        app.c      (instead of src/app.c)
        app_main.c (instead of src/app_main.c)
  
  Of course, there would be a need to do a lookup in the database for each 
  basename specified (to derieve the full path of the file)

o Refcounts for DEPS[]["tars"] and TARS[]["incs"]

o DEPS walk and TARS walk to figure out files/targets to rebuild based on 
  modifications
